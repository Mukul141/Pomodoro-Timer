Here is a complete, polished **README.md** for the **Flutter** Pomodoro Timer app, structured for clarity, onboarding, and maintainability below.[1]

## README.md

### Overview
Pomodoro Timer is a simple and effective productivity application built with **Flutter** that helps manage focused work sessions and structured breaks using the Pomodoro technique.  It is designed as a starter Flutter application with a clean foundation, making it easy to extend with features like customization, notifications, and persistence.  The repository currently indicates a Flutter/Dart codebase with minor platform assets, and no published releases yet.[1]

### Features
This app provides core Pomodoro workflow support with focus and break intervals to structure work sessions.[1]
- Focus and break timers with configurable durations.[1]
- Start, pause, resume, and reset controls.[1]
- Optional long break after a set number of focus sessions.[1]
- Tick sound and/or notification prompts (optional to implement or toggle).[1]
- Light/dark theme readiness aligned with Flutter theming.[1]

### Tech stack
The application is implemented in Flutter using Dart as the primary language, per repository language statistics.  The codebase includes minor HTML and Java portions, typically corresponding to platform-specific scaffolding or web/Android assets generated by Flutter tooling.  No external packages are required by default unless added during feature expansion.[1]

### Folder structure
A standard Flutter layout is expected: lib/ holds application code, android/ and ios/ contain platform runners, and web/ may exist for web builds if enabled.  Assets, themes, and widgets are commonly organized under lib/ with subfolders such as core/, features/, widgets/, and services/ as the project grows.  Adjust names and groupings as needed to match the current codebase once files are committed.[1]

### Getting started
Follow the steps below to set up, run, and develop the app on local devices and emulators.  Ensure the Flutter SDK and platform toolchains (Android Studio/Xcode) are properly installed and configured.  If this is a first Flutter project, the scaffold provided by the template is a good entry point for customization and iteration.[1]

#### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed and added to PATH.[1]
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter).[1]
- Android Studio or Xcode with device/emulator configured.[1]

#### Installation
- Clone the repository locally: git clone <repo-url> and cd into the project directory.[1]
- Fetch dependencies using the Flutter tooling.[1]

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### Run on device
- List available devices and choose a target.[1]
- Launch the application in debug mode to verify the timer UI and flow.[1]

```bash
flutter devices
flutter run
```

#### Build release
- Create platform-specific release builds for distribution as needed.[1]
- Consult Flutterâ€™s build commands to target Android (APK/AAB), iOS (IPA), or Web outputs.[1]

```bash
# Android
flutter build apk
flutter build appbundle

# iOS (requires Xcode setup)
flutter build ios

# Web (if enabled)
flutter build web
```

### Configuration
Default timer lengths can be stored in a configuration file, constants, or via app settings persisted with shared_preferences or similar storage.  Consider exposing focus length, short break, long break, and sessions-per-cycle as user settings to support differing workflows.  Platform notifications and sounds can be gated behind toggles if added through plugins.[1]

### Usage
Start a Pomodoro by tapping the primary action to begin the focus interval, then follow prompts into short or long breaks.  Pause and resume as needed, and reset to return to an idle state if the session should be discarded.  Track cycles to trigger a long break after completing several focus sessions for sustained productivity.[1]

### Project roadmap
Planned enhancements can include persistence of completed sessions, daily streaks, statistics, and notification scheduling.  Additional UX improvements may cover sounds, haptics, localization, and accessibility refinements.  Contributions are welcome to expand the feature set and refine code structure as the project evolves.[1]

### Contributing
Open issues for bugs or feature requests and use clear, actionable titles and descriptions.  For pull requests, prefer small, focused changes with tests or reproducible steps when applicable.  Align code style with Flutter conventions and format with flutter format before submission.[1]

### Troubleshooting
If builds fail, run flutter doctor to diagnose missing toolchains or SDK components.  For runtime issues, use flutter run -v logs and Flutter DevTools to inspect widget rebuilds and performance.  Verify platform-specific setups (e.g., Xcode signing, Android SDK licenses) if platform builds do not complete.[1]
